            <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello Class,

        I am majoring in Cybersecurity & Software Development. This will be my second course in web development. I have plenty of experience with computers for many years now, I am also a Computer Technician & a PC Gamer so I like to build my own high-end gaming computers from scratch. 
        
    </p>
    <p>  
        I am interested in all the Computer Science field, & programming a website is a highly valued skill to have. I have taken other programming language courses such as Python & Java. I am hoping to become a good Web Developer by the end of this course & continue learning more programming languages.

    </p>
    <p>

        I am taking many classes. I am studying most days, I do not have much free time, but when I do, I like to spend time with my pets, family, & friends. I like to go out to eat & have a couple of drinks. I also enjoy just staying home & relaxing.
        </p>
